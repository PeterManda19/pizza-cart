**The "git_project_setup.sh" script assumes that you have already created a remote repository on GitHub.**
```python
Manually replace "<remote_repository_url>" in the script with the actual URL of your remote repository
before running it.
To run the script save it in the same directory as your project.
Make the script executable by running the following command: chmod +x git_project_setup.sh
Run the script by executing: ./git_project_setup.sh
The script will then automate the Git initialization, repository creation, branch switching, file
pushing, and branch deletion process, providing you with the deployment URL at the end
```
